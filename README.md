## The Problem 

Creators post their content and utilize multiple platforms while only having access to 1 at a time, or multiple windows open to see and track all their data at once. 
What if there was one place they could access their metrics, track and manage their income, and budget and set goals for the future of their career. 

## Project Description

* As a user I want to see all my social media, commerce, courses, and merch data in once place.

* the User will log in securely and for the app to remember my data. 

* If first log in, the User will put in my USER NAME for each platform, and any special API keys once and those to be remembered. 

* At this time, for each username/platform data that is provided, those widgets will be the widgets provided and the others will be hidden unless requested
              
* a button should unhide those widgets if the creator wants to add more platforms. (the user will be greeted with a "COMING SOON" on every platform we do not find API for)

* Upon second log in, the User will be greeted with the widgets of choice with their corresponding data. 

* A master widget spanning the whole top will be on top holding an average of all incomes, an average of entire social impact, and distance to goals.

* There should be a goal setting widget, or maybe a page? 

* Note some platforms we will not be able to gater financial or any data at all and should possibly have an input form for people to help calculate a total.

## Competition

Platforms like social blade[https://socialblade.com/youtube/c/1willcobb] and VidIQ [https://vidiq.com/] both leverage the YouTube API and parse comparisons. They also use key word searching with potentially the google search API. But they both are generally single platform and dont let you agigate multi platform or finances.
